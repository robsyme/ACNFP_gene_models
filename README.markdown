ACNFP Gene Models
==========

Non-model resources often have a set of gene models that evolve quite quickly, and it is easy to lose track of why particular genes were added, removed or modified. Checking our gene models into version control allows us to track who editied which models and why (assuming that people leave sensible commit messages). It also allows us to apply pre-commit hooks to ensure that the changes made do not result in incomprehensible gene models. NOTE: The hooks are yet to be finalised. The hooks will check to ensure that features are not left orphaned (eg: mRNA without gene) and that each protien does not include premature stop codons.

Genomes Currently Available
----------

### Stagonospora nodorum sn15 ###

S. nodorum sn15 was the first genome published by the ACNFP ([Hane et al., 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.107.052829)).

Genomes Coming Soon
----------
### Stagonospora nodorum sn79-1087 ###
